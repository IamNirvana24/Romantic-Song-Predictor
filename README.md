Howdy, Folks! 🤠  
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify whether a song is **Romantic 💖** or **Not Romantic ❌** based on two simple audio features: **Tempo (BPM)** and **Energy**.

This is a beginner-friendly classification project and part of a supervised machine learning playlist!

🎁 Bonus Tip
Want to check if the model really works?
🎧 Just take any song, find its Tempo (in BPM) and Energy level (scale of 0–100), plug them into the code — and let the model tell you whether it’s a Romantic song or not! 🔍💖


💡 How to Find Tempo & Energy?
Don’t know the tempo or energy of a song?
No problem — here’s how you can find it:

✅ Ask ChatGPT:

"What is the tempo and energy of [song name]?"

🔍 Use websites like:

Tunebat

SongBPM

Spotify audio features

Then plug those values into the model and test away! 🎯
